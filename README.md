# INF1631 - Discrete Structures

**2014.1**

Projects for the Discrete Structures course at PUC-Rio.


## Project 1

We analyzed and proved 3 theorems. From these proofs we derived algorithms, which were then implemented in Python. 

Finally, we measured the performance of the algorithms.

We produced a report using LaTeX.


## Project 2

Pending.
